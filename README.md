# Electra ‚Äì Electricity Bill Calculator

## üìå Overview

**Electra** is an innovative web-based application developed to simplify and streamline the process of calculating electricity bills. Designed using core web technologies including **HTML, CSS, and PHP**. Electra provides an interactive interface that enables users to input consumption figures, automatically calculates the bill, and presents a clear breakdown of the charges.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
Electra uses PHP for backend processing. The PHP code **will not run** on a static hosting service (such as GitHub Pages). To run the project locally, you must set up a PHP environment.
